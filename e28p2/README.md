## Notes for instructor

I did have a hard time with access on my computer at one point I had the site working and uploaded to my git (or so I thought) I tried to pull the files down turned out when I thought it uploaded it the permission was denied and I lost my project a week in. I feel like I ran out of time after that and didn't get a chance to make it look as pretty as I would have liked.
